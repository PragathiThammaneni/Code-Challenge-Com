# Code-Challenge-Com

For this code challenge, I have used Java for solving the problem 

<b>Source Code:</b>
You can find the solution in Source folder -> SumOfDigits.java and a test.tmp file  

<b>Documentation:</b>
Contains the screen shots of the test cases <br>

<b>Build/Execute:</b>
For executing the solution, you can open the Java file in eclipse and run it as a Java Application.<br>
The test.tmp contains a string in a file for executing the scenario - reading the string from file and printing the sum of digits (location of this file must be given while executing for -f /you can locate desktop too)
