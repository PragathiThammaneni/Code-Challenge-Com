# Code-Challenge-Com

For this code challenge , I have used Java for solving the problem 

You can find the solution in source folder  ->SumOfDigits.java and a test.tmp file  and the executed test cases screenshot in Documentation folder

For executing the solution you can open the Java file in eclipse and run it as a Java Application.

The test.tmp contains a string in a file for executing the scenario - reading the string from file and printing the sum of digits (location of this file has to be given while executing /you can place it on desktop )

A short video of my execution :
