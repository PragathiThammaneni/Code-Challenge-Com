# Code-Challenge-Com

For this code challenge, I have used Java for solving the problem 

<b>Source Code:</b>
You can find the solution in Source folder -> SumOfDigits.java and a test.tmp file  

<b>Documentation:</b>
Contains the screen shots of the test cases 
Test case S.No	Test Case	Status
1	Reading string from console and displaying the sum	->Pass
2	Reading a string from file and evaluating the sum of digits	->Pass
3	Reading a string and handling hex values and returning the sum of digits ->	Pass
4	Returning the sum as zero for the string which doesnâ€™t contains any digits & also exception handling 	Pass

Build/Execute:
For executing the solution, you can open the Java file in eclipse and run it as a Java Application.
The test.tmp contains a string in a file for executing the scenario - reading the string from file and printing the sum of digits (location of this file must be given while executing for -f /you can locate desktop too)
